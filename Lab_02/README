Implement at least 3 blinking schemes for all 4 LEDs on the board.
2 buttons would be used to select scheme (next one, previous one).
2 buttons would be used to select blinking speed (speed up, slow down).
Button at the middle of cross should be used to turn on/off blinking.
All buttons need to be processed by interrupts.
