Need to implement PWM signal generator.
Time4 need to be used (this is mandatory).
STM32F407 need to be switched for external clock (HSE).
2 buttons would be used to set signal frequency (up and down; +/- 5 kHz step).
2 buttons would be used to set duty cycle (+/- 5% step each button press).
Middle button would be used to select signal output (PD15, PD14, PD13, PD12 or no output (disable case)). Cyclic selection scheme.
